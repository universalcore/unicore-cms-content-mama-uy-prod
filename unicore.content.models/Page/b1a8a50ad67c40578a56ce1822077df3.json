  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nYour baby can be born any day now! Inside your womb he\r\nis shedding the fine hair he grew in the middle of pregnancy. He is also\r\nlosing the waxy coating on his skin which protected him while he was floating\r\nin the fluid inside your womb. \r\n\r\nYour baby is developing layers of fat under his\r\nskin, which will help keep him warm when he is born. Newborn babies need to be\r\nkept warm. The best way to do this is to hold him close to your chest inside\r\nyour clothes. \r\n\r\nYou may wonder how you will know when labour starts. There are\r\nthree ways that labour may begin. \r\n\r\n1. You may notice a bloodstained discharge on\r\nyour underwear. This is a sign that labour may begin in the next day or two.\r\n\r\n2.You may have contractions that feel like period pains. They get that\r\nstronger, regular and more painful as labour progresses. \r\n\r\n3.You may have a gush\r\nor trickle of water. If this happens you should go straight to the health\r\nfacility. \r\n\r\nMake sure you know how to get to the health facility before labour\r\nstarts. You need a midwife, nurse or doctor to care for you if you are in\r\nlabour. Check that you have credit on your phone and money for a bus or taxi.\r\n\r\n",
