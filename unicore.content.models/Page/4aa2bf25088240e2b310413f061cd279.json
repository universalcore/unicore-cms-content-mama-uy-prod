  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA \r\n\r\nThere are so many people giving me advice about feeding my newborn baby, I just don't know what to think! Some of my friends say I must stick to certain times in the day to feed my baby like every 4 hours on the hour.\r\n\r\nBut I can't possibly let her cry when she seems to be hungry and I can't force her to drink when she is not. So I just pick her up when she is restless and starts to niggle and put her on my breast. Usually she latches on and starts drinking until she is full. Then my breast, which was quite hard and full before, becomes soft and feels empty. \r\n\r\nI try to let her drink from both my breasts to relieve the discomfort I am feeling when they get too full. My baby usually becomes very sleepy after drinking, so I gently hold her upright and let her burp and then put her down to sleep. And judging from the size of her yellow and smelly poop, she must get enough food!\r\n\r\nThen another mother told me that I must give her cooled, boiled water between feeds from when she is 6 months because babies can get dehydrated. It is quite hot in the day, so I thought I would give it a try. But my baby has not sucked on anything else than on my breasts. So when I tried to put a cup in her mouth, she pulled a face and didn't want it. \r\n\r\nShe makes 3 to 4 big wees in the day. The urine is pretty clear and not yellow or dark, so I think that she drinks enough liquid. Her skin is also rosy and her face gets rounder every day. I had her weighed at the clinic and she is putting on the right amount of weight, so I am starting to relax now.\r\n\r\nI found my way. My nipples were quite sore in the beginning but then somebody told me that my baby has to take my breast further into her mouth. My nipple mustn\u2019t get squeezed on her hard palate, but rather be further back in her mouth, where it is softer. Since I did that, it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore when I feed her. \r\n\r\nSometimes she doesn\u2019t latch on properly and then I let her open her mouth wider and latch on again. Sometimes it works right away but sometimes we both have to try a couple of times. It gets easier the more often we do it. \r\n\r\nNow I find breastfeeding easy and natural, and so convenient that I can go anywhere and feed my baby wherever I want!\r\n\r\n**MAMA HELP: Your baby is getting enough milk if she is having regular feeds, 6 to 8 wet nappies a day and gaining weight. She needs no other food or liquid other than breastmilk for the first 6 months.**\r\n",
