  "content": "Created by BabyCenter Your baby is still small enough to fit into the palm of\nyour hand. She is growing hair on her head and fine, soft hair all over her\nbody. On the tips of her fingers she is developing tiny fingerprints. Inside\nyour womb, your baby floats safely in fluid. She is protected from bumps and\nkept warm by the fluid. Babies can get hiccups. This feels like a regular drum\nbeat in your womb, which can last a few minutes. You may be feeling less\nnauseous now and find you are suddenly hungry. Eat well. Remember to eat a\nvariety of foods each day. Eat an extra handful of food at each meal. Make\nsure your food is safe and fresh, not stale or old. You will also gradually\nfeel less tired and have more energy. The afterbirth or placenta has developed\ninside your womb now and this supports your baby. It will be delivered just\nafter your baby is born. You may find that your clothes feel a bit tighter\naround your waist and breasts. Your pregnancy will show soon, as a small bump\nlow down on your tummy. Being pregnant makes you less resistant to germs, so\nyou may get more coughs and colds. Wash your hands with soap and clean, safe\nwater regularly. It\u2019s the best way to get rid of germs.\n\n",
